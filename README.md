# Minesweeper-Game
I created this game using python. It is exactly the same as the typical minesweeper game where you choose where you want do dig and if a bomb is not hit, it will reveal surrounding bombs nearby. If a bomb is hit, you will lose. If you are able to dig everywhere and not strike a single bomb, you will win the game!
